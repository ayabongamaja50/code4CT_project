          Code for Cape Town (Code4CT) is a programme that introduces young girls to basic web building skills and exposes them to opportunities in the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) sector. Participants are trained in web development, design principles, as well as courses in professional development. Code4CT aims to inspire a generation of young girls who are well-prepared with a toolkit of technical and soft skills in order to achieve high impact in the workplace.

          These are skills that everyone should have. Even if you have no intention of becoming a professional coder, you will benefit from knowing how to think in this way in this increasingly computerized economy. A growing number of permanent job positions that use information technology to deliver a product or a service are becoming available in the local economy.  It is estimated that nearly 75000 such jobs will come online in South Africa within the next five years.  These digital jobs will mostly be driven by the ICT, Business Process Outsourcing (BPO), and the financial services industries.  These are the fastest growing sectors in our economy.  They are also the sectors that have the highest demand for entry-level digital skills.

           <h4>OUR MISSION </h4>
           <p>
             Code4CT is broadening perspectives about career opportunities for many girls and is showing them that the ICT sector offers exciting career paths with the opportunity for social impact. Through using coding and web building skills, participants are exposed to how IT skills can be applied to solve problems, and they are encouraged to use their knowledge to tackle a real local challenge.

           <h4> OUR HELP </h4>
           <p>
            Grade 10 learners are introduced to web development and work on a real life coding project during a two week holiday program. During this time they are exposed to numerous innovative tech companies and aspirational female mentors.

         </div>

         <div id="paragraph11">
           <h4> OUR SUPPORTS </h4>
           <p>
             Throughout the program our young coders work in groups to solve real-life problems. They are exposed to an enabling professional network of tech companies, tutors, mentors and likeminded peers.

             Through doing so, they foster the ability to communicate effectively, collaborate and apply critical thinking to solve complex problems. Learners perceive that they are capable of leveraging technology to create valuable solutions, and see technology as a powerful tool to create social change.
